        <p>I think it’s time to resume writing diaries, at least writing something every couples of days. It’s been months since I stop writing, and life doesn’t seem to change a lot. That means the diary was not important to me. I think it’s time to make it important. I shall no longer record lives, like I used to do. I shall create lives, in accordance to my goal of live, that to live as an art.</p>
<p>I’m in a dilemma. On one side, I don’t think it’s appropriate to interpret life too much, in the same way that I should not judge anyone too much. Life comes in me, in a divine and splendid way, and if I arbitrarily give it my interpretation, no matter how good I am, it always ruins it. I first realized this a few years ago, when I try to make a poem on a beautiful dream I had, and I thought what if the dream was real, that the birds, the people and cities were all real; and they are real, I know that, they are in some dimensions unfathomable by human beings. What would they feel if they knew that I was trying to distort their images just for the enjoyment of myself? I thought that’s not fair, and I’m always careful not to do that. And I hate people doing that; I feel angry when people over-interpret myths.<br>But on the other side, life is such a big pool of beautiful things. I will never run out of imaginations when I swim in this pool. It’s full of beautiful people, intricate complications and innumerable possibilities. If I were to experience life like a baby, pretending that I have no experience living in this world, then I could probability be the best artist in the world. But that’s definitely hard. And should I do that? Could I pretend to be someone else to experience the world? Isn’t that in conflict with my believe that I shall not distort the world? Ah, I don’t know, I don’t know.</p>
<p>For now, I’ll just betray myself, and write things out of my mind and don’t care about any morality, until I figure things out.</p>
<p>I met Nick yesterday. I was walking up flagstaff hill, hoping to find someone longly like me and have a conversation about the world, and I heard someone playing banjo and singing folk songs. I’ve never heard anyone singing folk songs in the real life; I thought they were lost in the dust of the history, and the singing awaked me.<br>I walked to the young banjo player on the hill. He looked 25, wearing a Steeler T-shirt and a brown hat. He sang really loud, with a harsh voice, and you could hear him a few hundreds yards away. He reminded me of artists and intellectuals in Washington Square, New York, and I believe he could easily blended in that environment and make people believe he’s the heir of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, you know, that generation of folk artists.</p>
<p>“Can I sit here?” I pointed to the grass besides him.<br>“Sure, I’ll just sing on my own and you enjoy yourself.” His speaking voice sounded Northern and was more in accordance with his looking.<br>“Are you a professional musician?” I was immensely curious in him and that was the question I cared most among tons of others.<br>“Nah, I had only made like 50 bucks in my life with music.”<br>“Ah.” I said.<br>“I’m Nick.” He reached out his hand.<br>“I’m Max. It’s nice to meet you.”<br>And he continued to sing, and he told me these were old English folk songs, hundreds of years old. I knew some good old folk songs like “Ellen Barbara”, and I really like listening to them. He obviously knew tons more.<br>We had sparse conversations when he’s not singing. He told me he’s from DC, and I told him I’m from somewhere near Shanghai. Then he asked me questions every American would ask a foreigner, and I happily told him a little bit about the country and the city I come from. He was very good at picking up my English with accent. I always speak unconsciously with a stronger accent when I talk to someone who readily accept my alien identity, and with him I sometimes even couldn’t structure proper sentences; I just let them broken.<br>At some point I asked him about his job. I didn’t directly ask this question, because that would be rude, but nevertheless he told me he’s half a bum.<br>“I’m actually half a bum.” He said.<br>“Really? Seriously?” I couldn’t believe it, because the way he’s dressing wasn’t no difference from my peers. He would probability be a cooler one among my friends. Also, I was reading a lot of books about bum and vagabonding recently, and how coincident it is that I met a real bum near the campus!<br>“Yeah.” He gave me a nice smile.<br>“You know what?”, I said excitedly. “I’m thinking about taking a gap year after graduate, and go vagabonding around the world. I haven’t told too many people about this yet, because you know, it’s too big a decision to make. And I worry if it’s too strange to be different, you know, when people around me are very normal, looking for jobs and doing researches.”<br>“Don’t worry about this. With a CMU degree you can mess up with life anyway you want and get back quite easily.” And I agree; that’s the truest words I’ve heard in a long time, and he continued to say, “When I finish high school I went to Australia and spent one year there, then I went to college, spent one semester and quitted, with the same reason, you know, people around me are just too normal.” We paused for a while, and he picked up the banjo and sang. It’s a song about a girl who abandoned “me”, got lost in the sea and met a ship, and “I” told the captain not to save her. But I definitely understood the song wrong, because I could only picked up a few words when he sang it, and I filled the gaps in the story all by myself. But I don’t care, you know, at least for now when I’m writing this.<br>“Do you often come here?” I asked because I wanted to see him often.<br>“No, it’s a place you would only come when you had a bad day.” He said, while smiling without a hint that he had a bad day.<br>At this point I need to tell you what the flagstaff hill, the lawn under out butts, looks like. It is a huge land of grass, lying on a gently sloped hill, and when you are on the bottom of it, the people up the hill look just like specks of dusts. But it’s not so dauntingly big, nevertheless it’s just a grassland, and walking up the hill takes no more then five minutes. In the summer the city of Pittsburgh will play open-air movies twice a week at dusk, and the place will be filled with people. While the movie is playing, the sun slowly descends into the buildings of University of Pittsburgh far away on another hill. The sky will turn into glowing red, mixed with all other colors. The whole world burns, in a quiet and mild manner. And the movies often played are family movies or comedies, so you could hear people laughing and clapping their hands. It is a magnificent scene, making you believe every good things about this world. And while Nick and I was talking the sun was about to fall behind the buildings, and I knew a beautiful show of light was about to start.<br>“So you had a bad day?” I’m not sure if it’s an appropriate question to ask, but I think Nick wouldn’t mind.<br>“I was nearly fired. I work for a company that makes composite and the boss can’t afford to pay me anymore. I’m really poor.”<br>“Well consider making some money by street performing, you know, people are nice here and I bet you can get make a decent amount of money out of it.”<br>“That’s what I plan to do in Southside tonight. A lot of bars there. People will pay more when they get drunk. But I’m thinking how I can get there. I may need to walk. I don’t have money to take a bus.”<br>“That’s a long walk!” I said.<br>“Yeah, ha.” He smiled a little embarrassingly.<br>Then he sang more songs. After he finish each song someone in the distant shout “yahoo” and clapped hands, we couldn’t see who the person is so Nick waived hands to the vast openness. In this meantime the sun has fallen down completely, and sky was decorated with layers of multiple colors.<br>“You know, the good thing about being a bum is that I’m very free. I don’t have debt; no homework, no exam. I’m poor but I’m not worried for now; maybe tomorrow I’ll start to worry, but I don’t care for now. Now I’ll just sit here, singing.”<br>“You have any plan? You have any places in mind that you wanna go or you want to settle here?”<br>He think deeply for quite a long time, and said he didn’t know.<br>We sat in silence for a while; the world was full of unhearable sounds so it didn’t feel that quiet. Then I thought I needed to go.<br>“I gonna go.”<br>“Oh Yeah?”<br>“Hey, um, if you don’t mind, I can leave you some quarters to take the bus. I happened to have a lot of quarters. Do you mind that?…”<br>“I want to say no.”<br>“Take it, really.” I fetched a handful of quarters from my backpack and handed it to Nick.<br>“Wow that’s a lot. Thank you.”<br>“Yeah, thank you for singing all these good songs.” I stood up and ready to leave.<br>“I hope you’ll be a good bum, for at least part of your life.”<br>“Yeah.” I wanted to say more but my English suddenly became very poor and didn’t know how to say what I’m suppose to say.<br>“See you.”<br>“Yeah, see you.”<br>Then I left. I didn’t hear him sing on my way home, maybe he’s left and was on his way to Southside. I wish him all the luck. The sky was on its transition to deep blue, and I thought about what a “good bum” mean. How plain the word “good” is.<br>I should and will be a good bum. I thought.</p>
<p>If you ever wonder what the title mean, it means nothing. I started writing this page several days ago and had changed its content many times. When I started writing there was a heavy rain, so I wrote it on the title.</p>
