        <h2 id="DO-NOT-SHARE"><a href="#DO-NOT-SHARE" class="headerlink" title="DO NOT SHARE"></a><span style="color:red">DO NOT SHARE</span></h2><p>I interviewed at Google Pittsburgh on Oct. 12 2016, and got an offer a week later. I’ve long wanted to write this experience for the reference for future interviewees, and now I got some time to kill.</p>
<p>A recruiter named Matt contacted me at the end of the summer, asking if I’m graduating next spring and would be interested in the opportunities at Google. The email was addressed in a very personal way; he mentioned my class and Hackathon projects which are written in my resume, and said he’s impressed (actually I don’t think there’s anything to be impressed about). I guess he had my contact because I previously applied to Google and had my information in the pool, and he randomly discovered me. Matt worked at Google Austin office; he’s a pretty chill guy, like most Google employees.</p>
<p>I updated my resume to include my experience in summer, and sent out to him. It was after about 2 weeks into the semester that we had a phone call. It was pretty informal; we talked about my summer research assistant jobs in CMU. After the phone call he sent me a coding challenge; it was really easy and took my only about 10 minutes to finish two questions. A few days later he congratulated me saying that I was officially approved by Google’s recruiting team, and asked my availabilities to set up an on-site interview. No technical phone interviews! That is fast! I thought.</p>
<p>Karen, a recruiter at Google Pittsburgh office, took my case from Matt and became my contact person. We had a few emails and phone calls to set up the on-site interview. She also signed me up for a interview training session. It was a Skype meeting with a Google software engineer and a few other interview candidates. We went over a few tips, like always clarifying the question before thinking about it. It was not super informative, but made me feel more comfortable about the interviewing process.</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn’t have a thorough preparation plan, but I think the courses in CMU already prepared most people for this kind of interviews. The emphasis of functional programming in CMU’s curriculum is definitely a good plus; at least you know how to use “map” and “filter” in your Python code to greatly improve the conciseness and readability. Also 15-451, the most comprehensive undergraduate algorithm course at CMU, is extremely helpful. It is not a hard course, and the algorithms and ideas thought in the course, like rolling hashing, repeatedly appear in the coding challenges. In addition, Google had removed design questions in interviews for undergraduates, so I don’t find software engineering and system courses particularly helpful. Also even if companies ask undergraduate design questions, most time you can tackle them with common sense; there’s no need to prepare.</p>
<p>I did a few (around 20) questions on Leetcode. I bought the subscription so I had access to the interview question inventories for particular companies. I solved a few questions appearing most often at Google, and gained some confidence. I didn’t encounter any of these in the real interview, though.</p>
<p>On the interview day I took a Uber to Pittsburgh office. It was schedule at 9:45. The receptionist checked me in and gave me a bottle of water. A few minutes later my recruiter, Karen, picked me up. She walked me around and introduced this and that, with which I was already familiar. She told me they raised chicken on the roof; that was surprising.</p>
<p>I was led to a small conference room, sitting in front of a huge white board. I would go over 4 interviews, each lasting 40 minutes and involving one coding challenge, and a lunch break; these session were all between me and different Google engineers. I asked one interviewer if Google has a code challenge database where they pick questions. He told me he didn’t know. I was told that most interviewers have 2-3 questions in hands that they’ve used for dozens of times and know how to distinguish people from good to bad. They all vary in difficulties, but a interviewee only need to outperform others to receive a good score, so there’s no need to panic if you get a hard question.</p>
<p>The first question I got was pretty hard. It’s about finding the majority (element appearing over 50% times) in a sorted sequence. I immediately answer the question using a HashTable, with complexity O(n). I admitted that’s not a good solution and spent the next 10 minutes drawing and experimenting on the whiteboard. A good advice that many people will give to interviewees is never stop talking, so I talked the whole time while I was thinking; it slowed down my thinking process, but I quite enjoy doing so. I tried and explained some standard algorithmic ideas, like divide-and-conquer, to somewhat show off that I knew these things although I was already certain it won’t work. While I was trying I suddenly came up with a O(log n) solution. I explained it to the interviewer and he approved it. Then I started to code it up. The solution involves a variant of binary search, and was pretty painful to code on a whiteboard. I confessed to the interviewer that I’ll definitely make mistakes, and he told me not to worry at first. Somewhere in the middle of the process I realized that I was writing rubbish; the code was too complex and I didn’t know how to proceed. I asked how many time do I have, and I had 15 minutes to go. So I wiped the rubbish out and did again from scratch. After I finished coding I checked some edge cases, went over a few tests and fixed a few bugs. The interviewer seemed satisfied.</p>
<p>The second question was easy. I didn’t come up with the solution at first, because I misunderstood the question a bit at first. But overall it’s easy.</p>
<p>Then I went to lunch with a guy who just finished PhD from CMU. We talked about courses I was taking; we talked machine learnings; we talked about culture at Google. Both of us weren’t too talkative so there’s not a lot of conversation, but he always made sure that I felt relaxing and comfortable, which I very much appreciated. We got coffee after lunch and visited Google Pittsburgh’s new building across the street that’s just finished.</p>
<p>The next interview asked about DFS. There’s a long prologue that introduce the problem, but overall it’s simply a question about DFS. Nothing hard.</p>
<p>The fourth question is about OOP. I didn’t review anything about OOP so there’s some hassle. The question only checks your understanding of OOP and nothing else, but I made a stupid mistake. I forgot about inheritance. When asked to write a new class, I simply wrote a new class, and said the old code could be copied and inserted here and there.</p>
<p>The last recruiter walked me to the entrance, and we said goodbye. The interview was on Wednesday, and on the next Monday Karen gave me a call saying that I’ve got approval from the hiring committee. And the next Wednesday I got the official offer from Google Bay Area office.</p>
