        <p>I finished the exam 20 minutes early. Two questions were still left blank but I did’t care too much as I did’t know the answer. I looked around and saw people looking serious. I looked at the entire room and it was quiet. Alright, I think. Then I looked at TAs. They looked nice; I guess they’ll work for some good companies, contributing to the economy and also their own standard of living. Alright, I think. Nothing special was going on here, except that I’m writing it down so this moment may last longer.</p>
<p>The more I think about it the more I trust myself that I will create something for this world; things that I deem important but may not be seen the same by others. I am living in such a confusing world that everyone seems to know what they’re doing but they actually aren’t, and I need to tell them that. </p>

        <p>早上闹钟叫醒，看了会儿手机，然后继续睡，做梦，梦见回到了杭外。</p>
<p>那是中午十二点一刻，我还在教室，教室里还有少许的人。我说，谁一起去吃饭，然后三四个人就站了起来。里面有我的初中同学，也有高中同学。我刚要出门，发现我光着脚，于是走回我靠窗的座位，在座位下找到了我的鞋子。我后面坐着孙一侃；他在埋头写作业，他说他的鞋子也经常找不到。（孙一侃什么时候坐我后面？那是高一刚开学的时候了。）</p>
<p>走出教室，就到了小学的走廊。我们走下小学的楼梯，在二楼的转角看到了一个杭外的同学（加了微信Facebook，常看到她的消息但没见过面），她在等人。我们一伙人穿过小学的操场。大家都觉得我喜欢一个同行的女生，其实我并不，她也不喜欢我，但我感觉得到气氛的微妙。（那是初一的事情）</p>
<p>走过小学食堂前的乒乓球桌的时候，一个大学的学弟加入了队伍，他显得很疲惫，说刚复习完什么科目。我说：“生物？”他说：“古生物<em>**</em>”（反正是很高级的东西）走进食堂，食堂的半空中都是架空的盘旋楼梯。我想杭外新的食堂还很有特色。我们在排队拿饭的时候，我就要醒了。</p>
<p>我该从哪里醒来？我可以从家里醒来。那会是个周末，虽然中学时候的周末并不见得怎么有趣，但是时间却是很长。周日晚上回到学校，感觉有半个世纪的新闻可以聊。我也可以从我大学的租房里醒来。我醒来后会看手机，吸收无趣的内容，然后昏着脑袋洗漱，早早地吃个早饭，之后开始补上个星期拉下的内容。生活没什么期待，毕竟一切都过得很快。</p>
<p>还在梦里的时候我想我要确认一下我在那里，睁开了眼，看到了房间的白色百叶窗。天气很好，但是悲从心来。我不知为何默念着“少壮不努力，老大徒伤悲”。我想着从中拼凑点新的内容来，然后我就醒了。</p>
<p>昨天和陈功聊天，我向他抱怨CMU是多么的单调无聊。他说我上个寒假一起去LA玩的小伙伴还是很阳光快乐的啊。我想也是啊，但我好久没见他们了。昨天刚看到一个同行的女生发朋友圈说秋天到了，但却没时间欣赏风景。我往沉寂了半个学期的约饭群发了消息，呼吁大家聚一聚。不知有多少人能来。</p>
<p>So, What is there?</p>

        <p>我在杭州中山北路上的锦江之星的电梯里，我思考着出门之后往哪里走。思考至出门，天太热，再返回室内，思考。</p>
<p>问题不在于天太热，不在于能去的地方太少。相反，我毫不畏惧炎热；在烈日下行走，穿行在浓稠的空气中，我能感受到的是平静；那是一种极致的冥想。而我能去的地方也不少，甚至，问题就在于，我能去所有的地方。</p>
<p>前一天我在宁波，我看着中国地图，安排即将开始的一周的行程。我想去兰州，我想去西安。可是高铁不通那里，若是乘坐飞机去访问一两个城市，未免太费周折。我理想的旅程，是乘坐高铁，途径若干个城市。每到一个城市，走一通，再换一个。我没有一定要去的地方，也没有必须要看的东西。好像一个玻璃球，在拼图上滚动，没有我拒绝的地方，也没有拒绝我的地方。</p>
<p>我说，去长沙吧。可是长沙太孤独，途径长沙的铁路线，往南可到达的大城市只有广州，未免太远。我往北看，合肥虽然并不是个旅游去处，可是我有同学在那儿，可以接待我，合肥往北，可到济南，天津，总的路程不过四五小时。我想可以。可是五天之内，三个城市，是不是太仓促了？而我又到底在寻找什么？史琳说，去青岛吧。在青岛待上一周，每天喝喝啤酒，看看书，傍晚在海边散散步；不去可以寻找什么，说不定就能找到什么。想来也不错。就在我们查好机票查好住宿之后，我舅舅又不同意史琳和我同去，这下子兴趣大减。我想干脆不想了，到了杭州再说。</p>
<p>到了杭州，我更没方向感，如之前所说，我甚至不知道出门后往哪儿走。我问遍所有的朋友，他们要么要开学了，要么喜欢待在家里而不想出远门。我犹豫了一会儿，出门左拐，在烈日下，往湖滨银泰走去。</p>

        <p>I think it’s time to resume writing diaries, at least writing something every couples of days. It’s been months since I stop writing, and life doesn’t seem to change a lot. That means the diary was not important to me. I think it’s time to make it important. I shall no longer record lives, like I used to do. I shall create lives, in accordance to my goal of live, that to live as an art.</p>
<p>I’m in a dilemma. On one side, I don’t think it’s appropriate to interpret life too much, in the same way that I should not judge anyone too much. Life comes in me, in a divine and splendid way, and if I arbitrarily give it my interpretation, no matter how good I am, it always ruins it. I first realized this a few years ago, when I try to make a poem on a beautiful dream I had, and I thought what if the dream was real, that the birds, the people and cities were all real; and they are real, I know that, they are in some dimensions unfathomable by human beings. What would they feel if they knew that I was trying to distort their images just for the enjoyment of myself? I thought that’s not fair, and I’m always careful not to do that. And I hate people doing that; I feel angry when people over-interpret myths.<br>But on the other side, life is such a big pool of beautiful things. I will never run out of imaginations when I swim in this pool. It’s full of beautiful people, intricate complications and innumerable possibilities. If I were to experience life like a baby, pretending that I have no experience living in this world, then I could probability be the best artist in the world. But that’s definitely hard. And should I do that? Could I pretend to be someone else to experience the world? Isn’t that in conflict with my believe that I shall not distort the world? Ah, I don’t know, I don’t know.</p>
<p>For now, I’ll just betray myself, and write things out of my mind and don’t care about any morality, until I figure things out.</p>
<p>I met Nick yesterday. I was walking up flagstaff hill, hoping to find someone longly like me and have a conversation about the world, and I heard someone playing banjo and singing folk songs. I’ve never heard anyone singing folk songs in the real life; I thought they were lost in the dust of the history, and the singing awaked me.<br>I walked to the young banjo player on the hill. He looked 25, wearing a Steeler T-shirt and a brown hat. He sang really loud, with a harsh voice, and you could hear him a few hundreds yards away. He reminded me of artists and intellectuals in Washington Square, New York, and I believe he could easily blended in that environment and make people believe he’s the heir of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, you know, that generation of folk artists.</p>
<p>“Can I sit here?” I pointed to the grass besides him.<br>“Sure, I’ll just sing on my own and you enjoy yourself.” His speaking voice sounded Northern and was more in accordance with his looking.<br>“Are you a professional musician?” I was immensely curious in him and that was the question I cared most among tons of others.<br>“Nah, I had only made like 50 bucks in my life with music.”<br>“Ah.” I said.<br>“I’m Nick.” He reached out his hand.<br>“I’m Max. It’s nice to meet you.”<br>And he continued to sing, and he told me these were old English folk songs, hundreds of years old. I knew some good old folk songs like “Ellen Barbara”, and I really like listening to them. He obviously knew tons more.<br>We had sparse conversations when he’s not singing. He told me he’s from DC, and I told him I’m from somewhere near Shanghai. Then he asked me questions every American would ask a foreigner, and I happily told him a little bit about the country and the city I come from. He was very good at picking up my English with accent. I always speak unconsciously with a stronger accent when I talk to someone who readily accept my alien identity, and with him I sometimes even couldn’t structure proper sentences; I just let them broken.<br>At some point I asked him about his job. I didn’t directly ask this question, because that would be rude, but nevertheless he told me he’s half a bum.<br>“I’m actually half a bum.” He said.<br>“Really? Seriously?” I couldn’t believe it, because the way he’s dressing wasn’t no difference from my peers. He would probability be a cooler one among my friends. Also, I was reading a lot of books about bum and vagabonding recently, and how coincident it is that I met a real bum near the campus!<br>“Yeah.” He gave me a nice smile.<br>“You know what?”, I said excitedly. “I’m thinking about taking a gap year after graduate, and go vagabonding around the world. I haven’t told too many people about this yet, because you know, it’s too big a decision to make. And I worry if it’s too strange to be different, you know, when people around me are very normal, looking for jobs and doing researches.”<br>“Don’t worry about this. With a CMU degree you can mess up with life anyway you want and get back quite easily.” And I agree; that’s the truest words I’ve heard in a long time, and he continued to say, “When I finish high school I went to Australia and spent one year there, then I went to college, spent one semester and quitted, with the same reason, you know, people around me are just too normal.” We paused for a while, and he picked up the banjo and sang. It’s a song about a girl who abandoned “me”, got lost in the sea and met a ship, and “I” told the captain not to save her. But I definitely understood the song wrong, because I could only picked up a few words when he sang it, and I filled the gaps in the story all by myself. But I don’t care, you know, at least for now when I’m writing this.<br>“Do you often come here?” I asked because I wanted to see him often.<br>“No, it’s a place you would only come when you had a bad day.” He said, while smiling without a hint that he had a bad day.<br>At this point I need to tell you what the flagstaff hill, the lawn under out butts, looks like. It is a huge land of grass, lying on a gently sloped hill, and when you are on the bottom of it, the people up the hill look just like specks of dusts. But it’s not so dauntingly big, nevertheless it’s just a grassland, and walking up the hill takes no more then five minutes. In the summer the city of Pittsburgh will play open-air movies twice a week at dusk, and the place will be filled with people. While the movie is playing, the sun slowly descends into the buildings of University of Pittsburgh far away on another hill. The sky will turn into glowing red, mixed with all other colors. The whole world burns, in a quiet and mild manner. And the movies often played are family movies or comedies, so you could hear people laughing and clapping their hands. It is a magnificent scene, making you believe every good things about this world. And while Nick and I was talking the sun was about to fall behind the buildings, and I knew a beautiful show of light was about to start.<br>“So you had a bad day?” I’m not sure if it’s an appropriate question to ask, but I think Nick wouldn’t mind.<br>“I was nearly fired. I work for a company that makes composite and the boss can’t afford to pay me anymore. I’m really poor.”<br>“Well consider making some money by street performing, you know, people are nice here and I bet you can get make a decent amount of money out of it.”<br>“That’s what I plan to do in Southside tonight. A lot of bars there. People will pay more when they get drunk. But I’m thinking how I can get there. I may need to walk. I don’t have money to take a bus.”<br>“That’s a long walk!” I said.<br>“Yeah, ha.” He smiled a little embarrassingly.<br>Then he sang more songs. After he finish each song someone in the distant shout “yahoo” and clapped hands, we couldn’t see who the person is so Nick waived hands to the vast openness. In this meantime the sun has fallen down completely, and sky was decorated with layers of multiple colors.<br>“You know, the good thing about being a bum is that I’m very free. I don’t have debt; no homework, no exam. I’m poor but I’m not worried for now; maybe tomorrow I’ll start to worry, but I don’t care for now. Now I’ll just sit here, singing.”<br>“You have any plan? You have any places in mind that you wanna go or you want to settle here?”<br>He think deeply for quite a long time, and said he didn’t know.<br>We sat in silence for a while; the world was full of unhearable sounds so it didn’t feel that quiet. Then I thought I needed to go.<br>“I gonna go.”<br>“Oh Yeah?”<br>“Hey, um, if you don’t mind, I can leave you some quarters to take the bus. I happened to have a lot of quarters. Do you mind that?…”<br>“I want to say no.”<br>“Take it, really.” I fetched a handful of quarters from my backpack and handed it to Nick.<br>“Wow that’s a lot. Thank you.”<br>“Yeah, thank you for singing all these good songs.” I stood up and ready to leave.<br>“I hope you’ll be a good bum, for at least part of your life.”<br>“Yeah.” I wanted to say more but my English suddenly became very poor and didn’t know how to say what I’m suppose to say.<br>“See you.”<br>“Yeah, see you.”<br>Then I left. I didn’t hear him sing on my way home, maybe he’s left and was on his way to Southside. I wish him all the luck. The sky was on its transition to deep blue, and I thought about what a “good bum” mean. How plain the word “good” is.<br>I should and will be a good bum. I thought.</p>
<p>If you ever wonder what the title mean, it means nothing. I started writing this page several days ago and had changed its content many times. When I started writing there was a heavy rain, so I wrote it on the title.</p>

        <p>Marylou was watching Dean as she had watched him clear scross the country and back, out of the corner of her eye - with a sullen, sad air, as though she wanted to cut off his head and hide it in her closet, and envious and rueful love of him so amazingly himslef, all raging and sniffy and crazy-wayed, a smile of tender dotage but also sinister envy that frightened me about her, a love she knew would never bear fruit because when she looked at his hangjawed bony face with its male self-containment and absentminded ness she knew he was too mad. Dean was convinced Marylou was a whore; he confided in me that she was a pathological liar. But when she watched him like this it was love too; and when Dean noticed he always turned with his big false flirtatious smile, with the eyelashes fluttering and the teeth pearly white, while a moment ago he was only dreaming in his eternity. Then Marylou and I both laughed - and Dean gave no sign of discomfiture, just a goofy glad grin that said to us, Ain’t we gettin’ out kicks <em>anyway</em>? And that was it.</p>

        <p>又是周五了。我这周干了什么？</p>
<p>我的兼职工作开始了。给一个经济实验室打工。我非常喜欢这个实验室的人。老板是个非常有阅历的年轻教授，实验室主管是个CMU刚毕业的好看妹子。他们有非常多的任务需要做。现在我的任务是把政客的照片从各大新闻媒体上扒下来，之后让人评分看看各大新闻媒体对政客的照片选择是否有偏见。老板对这个项目还是很期待的；他说他认识很多新闻界的人，到时候可以搞个大新闻。还要开新闻发布会。</p>
<p>我开始写歌了。但同时有太多的问题需要思考。上学期上的Rooks of Rock and Roll让我意识到很多音乐的本质在于人。一个音乐人的成长是发现自己声音的过程。我感到我对自己声音越来越能接受，但我不知道如何去操控它。我不知道哪些是属于我的声音，哪些是不属于我的。我不知道我有多大的空间去探索。总之很多问题。一天玩桌游的时候我在唱歌（其实我一直在唱歌），顾一凡不满地说我的声音需要有更多层级感。我突然有了点灵感：也许我可以用没有层次感的声音唱歌。</p>
<p>我还意识到了拥有自由的困难。</p>
